This folder will contain your custom icons.

For now, the application will use text-based icons (emoji) as placeholders.

Recommended icon sizes:
- App Icon: 256x256 (app_icon.png)
- Toolbar Icons: 32x32
- List Icons: 20x20

You can:
1. Create your own icons
2. Download from icon packs (flaticon.com, iconmonstr.com)
3. Use AI to generate custom icons
4. Hire a designer

Once you have icons, just drop them here and update resources.qrc!
